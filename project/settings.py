# Most values are Django settings, erasing the default values you can find in #
# libs/django/conf/global_settings.py. A lot of original Django settings arez #
# not changed so you'll have to refer to global_settings.py to know their     #
# value.                                                                      #

# Some values are for others Django apps.                                     #

# NOTE: the scope of this project is to show you how to do things in apps,    #

# I will specifically put a note when warning applys, and the first           #
